**Tensorflow implementation of our proposed DRCNN method for hyperspectral pansharpening.**

![Framework](https://github.com/yxzheng24/IEEE_GRSL_DRCNN/blob/main/Framework_GRSL20.png "Framework of the proposed method for hyperspectral pansharpening.")

## Usage
Here we take the experiments conducted on the [CAVE](https://www1.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/databases/multispectral/) data set as an example for illustration.

*   Training:
1.   Download the [CAVE](https://www1.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/databases/multispectral/) data set and put the data into the __./data_process/cave_ref/__ folder, which are served as the reference images. Note that you can also download the CAVE data set (in .mat format) from the Baidu Cloud links: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1tmuanIjXLXTEdaAsRxq1fw (Access Code: 3e53).
2.   Run *"get_hspan_cave.m"* to obtain LR-HSI and HR-PAN images.
3.   Run *"get_Hini_Hres_cave.m"* to genertate the initialized HSI and the residual HSI.
4.   Randomly select 22 HSI pairs from __./data_process/cave_Hini/__ and __./data_process/cave_Hres/__ folders to form the training set.
5.   Run *"get_traindata_h5.m"* to produce the HDF5 file for training.
6.   Run *"train_DRCNN.py"*.

*   Testing: 
    
    Run *"test_DRCNN.py"* by utilizing the pretrained model __./models/model_cave.h5__ to obtain the fused HSIs.

    Note that due to the large size of testing images, you may need to first manually download the 10 initialized HSIs (*.mat files) to your local folder under path __./data_process/cave_Hini/test_10Hini/__ by the given links of Baidu Cloud below.
